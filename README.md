# Emojislation - Project TATIA
Automatic text processing in AI, Final project - Université Côte d'Azur

Charafeddine ACHIR & Rafael BAPTISTA

The project aims to create a method of translating English phrases into corresponding sequences of emojis. Exploring the concept of vector cosine similarity to identify the most appropriate emoji for a given word. This is achieved by comparing word vectors with emoji vectors to find the closest match.

Key components of the project include the use of 'emo_uni', a comprehensive library providing textual representations for each emoji, and the 'emoji' Python library, which facilitates the conversion of words into emojis and vice versa.

Furthermore, the project utilizes GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), an extensive database of word vectors, to encompass a broad spectrum of the English lexicon. These GloVe vectors are integrated with spaCy, a powerful tool for advanced natural language processing, which is instrumental in generating vectors for emojis.

Overall, this project serves as an enriching experience, offering a deep dive into the nuances of language processing. It not only enhances understanding of natural language processing techniques but also bridges the gap between textual and visual communication.
