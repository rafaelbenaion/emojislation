The Emojislation project is focused on translating English phrases into corresponding sequences of emojis. This translation process is achieved through the application of vector cosine similarity, which identifies the most suitable emoji for each word by comparing word vectors with emoji vectors. Central to the project are two key resources: 'emo_uni', a library that provides textual representations for each emoji, and the 'emoji' Python library, enabling the conversion of words to emojis and vice versa. Additionally, the project utilizes GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), an extensive database of word vectors, integrated with spaCy, a tool for natural language processing, to generate corresponding emoji vectors. This endeavor provides a comprehensive exploration into language processing, bridging the gap between textual and visual communication and enhancing the understanding of natural language processing techniques.
